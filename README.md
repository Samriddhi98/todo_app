# 📋 Todo App

A **Flutter-based Todo application** built with **Clean Architecture** and **Bloc state management**.  
The app allows users to create, update, mark complete/incomplete, and organize tasks efficiently.  
Tasks can also be grouped by due dates (e.g., monthly) for better task management.

---

## ✨ Features
- Add new tasks with **title, description, priority, and due date**
- Mark tasks as **completed or incomplete**
- Update or delete existing tasks
- Group tasks by **due dates** (e.g., months)
- Local persistence using **Hive**
- Built with **Bloc** for predictable state management

### 🔹 Layers Explained
- **Data Layer**
    - Responsible for Hive integration and mapping models.
    - Implements repository interfaces from the domain layer.

- **Domain Layer**
    - Contains pure business logic.
    - Defines `TodoEntity`, repository contracts, and use cases (e.g., `AddTodo`, `UpdateTodo`, `ToggleCompletion`).

- **Presentation Layer**
    - UI built with Flutter widgets.
    - Uses **Bloc** for state management.
    - Responds to domain changes and user input.
